Hint: what does it mean for a utility function to be *ordinal* or *cardinal*? Why can multiple utility functions describe the same preferences?\n\n## Question 2\n\nDescribe, in your own words, what the *marginal rate of substitution* between two goods means. How is it different from the slope of the budget constraint?\n\n## Question 3\n\nDescribe, in your own words, what happens at the optimum consumption point. Why is it the optimum? What does the equality of the slope of the indifference curve and the slope of the budget constraint *mean*, in English?\n\n# Problems\n\n## Question 4\n\nJuan enjoys both music and fireworks. His income is \\$240 per month. Music streaming costs \\$12 per month, and fireworks cost \\$8 per bag.\n\n### Part A\n\nGraph the budget constraint Juan faces, with music on the vertical axis and fireworks on the horizontal axis.\n\n### Part B\n\nIf Juan spends all his income on music, how much music can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.\n\n### Part C\n\nIf Juan spends all his income on fireworks, how many bags of reworks can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.\n\n### Part D\n\nIf Juan spends half his income on fireworks and half his income on music, how much of each can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.\n\n### Part E\n\nConnect the dots to create Juan's budget constraint. What is the slope of the budget constraint?\n\n### Part F\n\nSuppose that a holiday bonus raises Juan's income temporarily to \\$360. Draw Juan's new budget constraint.\n\n### Part G\n\nNow suppose that during the holiday, with his holiday bonus, the price of fireworks increases to \\$12 and the price of music increases to 18. If he spends all of his income on fireworks, how many can Juan buy? How about music? What happens to his budget constraint, and why?\n\n## Question 5\n\nAshkar has the following utility function for consuming peanut butter $(p)$ and jelly $(j)$: $$u(p,j) = 3pj$$\n\nHis marginal utilities are:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nMU_p &= 3j\\\\\nMU_j &= 3p\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nPut $p$ on the horizontal axis and $j$ on the vertical axis.\n\n### Part A\n\nWrite an equation for $MRS_{p,j}$.\n\n### Part B\n\nSuppose he is currently consuming bundle[^1] $a = (4,1)$. How much utility is he getting?\n\n[^1]: Sandwich, I suppose!\n\n### Part C\n\nFrom his current consumption, how much *more* utility would he get by consuming 1 more $p$? What about 1 more $j$?\n\n### Part D\n\nFrom his current consumption, how many units of $j$ is he willing to give up to get 1 more unit of $p$ and remain indifferent? How many units of $p$ is he willing to give up to get 1 more $j$ and remain indifferent?\n\n### Part E\n\nSuppose he can choose between bundles $a = (4,1)$, $b=(2,2)$, and $c=(1,4)$. What are his preferences between them?\n\n### Part F\n\nWould he prefer bundle $d = (2,1)$ over a bundle from part E? Why or why not?\n\n### Part G\n\nSketch a graph, plotting bundles $a, b, c$, and $d$. Indicate any indifference curve(s) they are on, and how much utility each provides.\n\n## Question 6\n\nKelly's utility function for drinking Coke ($c$) and Pepsi ($p$) is given by:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n    u(c,p) &= 5c + 2p\\\\\n    MU_c &= 5\\\\\n    MU_p &= 2\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$ Put Coke on the horizontal axis and Pepsi on the vertical axis.\n\n### Part A\n\nCan Kelly get utility by consuming *only* Coke or *only* Pepsi?\n\n### Part B\n\nWrite an equation for $MRS_{c,p}$.[^2]\n\n[^2]: Hint: think about the relationship between these goods. It may not be a \"typical\" equation.\n\n### Part C\n\nAre the bundles $(c=2, p=5)$ and $(c=4,p=0)$ on the same indifference curve?\n\n### Part D\n\nWhat is $MRS_{c,p}$ when $c=1$ and $p=5$?\n\n### Part E\n\nGiven your answers, what is the relationship between Coke and Pepsi for Kelly?\n\n### Part F\n\nSketch a few indifference curves.\n\n## Question 7\n\nA consumer has the following utility function:\n\n$$u(x,y)=\\sqrt{xy}$$\n\n### Part A\n\nFill in the following table by calculating the utility for each bundle of $X$ and $Y$. Round to two decimal places.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"empty-cells: hide;border-bottom:hidden;\" colspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:hidden;padding-bottom:0; padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px;text-align: center; \" colspan=\"3\"><div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px; \">y</div></th>\n</tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> x </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> x </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> x </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> x </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part B\n\nGraph three indifference curves on the same graph below: the first showing the bundle(s) that yield a utility level of 1; the second showing the bundle(s) that yield a utility level of 2; the third showing the bundle(s) that yield a utility level of 3.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-problem-set_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Part C\n\nThe marginal utilities are given by:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nMU_x&=0.5x^{-0.5}y^{0.5}\\\\\nMU_y&=0.5x^{0.5}y^{-0.5}\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nwrite an equation for $MRS_{x,y}$.\n\n### Part D\n\nSuppose this consumer has an income of \\$10, the price of $x$ is \\$2.50, and the price of $y$ is also \\$2.50.
