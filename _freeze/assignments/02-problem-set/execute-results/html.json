Use examples as necessary. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.\n\n## Question 1\n\nDescribe, in your own words, the (i) price effect, (ii) real income effect, and (iii) substitution effect from a price change.\n\n## Question 2\n\nUnder what conditions can the law of demand be violated (however theoretical)?\n\n## Question 3\n\nFor each of the following pairs, which of the two goods is more likely to have a *low* price elasticity of demand (less elastic) and why? \n\n### Part A\nDemand for tangerines vs. demand for fruit\n\n### Part B\nDemand for beef next month vs. demand for beef over the next decade\n\n### Part C\nDemand for Exxon gasoline at the corner of 7th and Grand vs. demand for gasoline in the entire city\n\n### Part D\nDemand for insulin vs. demand for vitamins\n\n## Question 4\n\nSuppose that, holding prices constant, Alice has preferences over the number of books she purchases, illustrated in the table below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Income </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Books </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $10 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $20 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 26 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $30 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $35 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $40 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $45 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> $50 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDraw a smooth approximation of Alice's Engel curve for books, and indicate the range(s) of income over which books are *normal* and/or *inferior* goods.\n\n# Quantitative Applications\n\nShow all work for calculations. You may lose points, even if correct, for missing work. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.\n\n## Question 5\n\nSteve spends his disposable income on meals at restaurants $(r)$ and paperback novels $(n)$. His usual restaurant meal costs <span>&#36;</span>25, and paperback books cost <span>&#36;</span>8. When Steveâ€™s monthly income is <span>&#36;</span>240, he goes out to eat 8 times and purchases 5 books. When his income rises to <span>&#36;</span>282, he goes out to eat 10 times and purchases 4 books. \n\n### Part A\n\nCalculate the income elasticity for meals at restaurants $(r)$. Is this an inferior, necessity, or luxury good?\n\n### Part B\n\nCalculate the income elasticity for paperback novels $(n)$. Is this an inferior, necessity, or luxury good?\n\n## Question 6\n\nKendra buys eggs $(e)$, bagels $(b)$, and coffee $(c)$ for breakfast for the week.\n\n### Part A\n\nWhen eggs are <span>&#36;</span>2/carton, she buys 5 bagels. When the price of eggs falls to <span>&#36;</span>1/carton, she buys 4 bagels. Calculate the cross-price elasticity between eggs and bagels. Are they complements or substitutes for Kendra?\n\n### Part B\n\nWhen eggs are <span>&#36;</span>2/carton, she buys 3 cups of coffee. When the price of eggs falls to <span>&#36;</span>1/carton, she buys 6 cups of coffee. Calculate the cross-price elasticity between eggs and coffee. Are they complements or substitutes for Kendra?\n\n## Question 7\n\nSketch a graph showing an *increase* in the price of a good (on the horizontal axis, e.g. $x$ if you want). Indicate (i) the (real) income effect, (ii) substitution effect, and (iii) price effect on the graph. Labeling points and merely describing each of the three effects as a movement between specific points is sufficient. \n\n## Question 8\n\nThe demand for gym memberships is given by\n$$q_D=500-5p$$\n\n### Part A\n\nWrite the inverse demand function.\n\n### Part B\n\nCalculate the price elasticity of demand at a price of <span>&#36;</span>80. Is this relatively elastic or relatively inelastic?\n\n### Part C\n\nWhat is the total revenue at a price of <span>&#36;</span>80?\n\n### Part D\n\nCalculate the price elasticity of demand at a price of <span>&#36;</span>10. Is this relatively elastic or relatively inelastic?\n\n### Part E\n\nWhat is the total revenue at <span>&#36;</span>10?\n \n### Part F\n\nAt what price is demand unit elastic, i.e. $\\epsilon_D=-1$?\n\n### Part G\n\nWhat is the total revenue at the price you find in part (f)?",
