While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about *any* decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as [\"Rational Choice Theory\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory). This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of **constrained optimization**, so today we are only focusing on the *constraints* using the tool known as the \"budget constraint.\"\n\nWhile budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most \"alien\" material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It's perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, **read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.**^[And see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/graykimbrough/status/1291017699481575424) for an 100% accurate example of what you can expect in a common Ph.D textbook discussing preferences.]\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 4.3 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Bastiat, 1848 [“What is Seen and Not Seen”](https://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss.html?chapter_num=4#book-reader), (Section 1)\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Math Review Guide: Graphing Linear Equations ](https://micros23.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math/graphing.html)\n\nNow that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings *before* each class.\n\nIf you are following the textbook, we are going a bit out of order in two ways. It goes straight into (a review of principles, really) supply & demand in Chapters 1-3. We will ultimately get to supply and demand, but if you trust me, by the time we do later this semester, you will have a *much* richer understanding and appreciation for them, having understood **how they represent the decisions by optimizing individuals as buyers and sellers.**\n\nIt begins \"Consumer Theory\" as chapter 4. It also stars with the \"newer\" and \"weirder\" stuff first — indifference curves and utility functions, and then teaches budget constraints second. I will go in the *opposite* order to slowly acclimate you from familiar territory (linear equations) into newer tools and concepts (nonlinear functions, multivariate functions, optimization, etc). This is also a good time to review my [Math Review Guide](/files/math_review_guide.pdf) for next week.\n\nThe Bastiat reading is perhaps one of the greatest economic parables ever written, and demonstrates the importance of opportunity cost in clear thinking (especially about policy).\n\n### Optional/Referenced Readings\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Safner, 2019, \"Econometrics, Data Science, and Causal Inference\" (blog post)](https://ryansafner.com/post/econometrics-data-science-and-causal-inference/)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nToday we will be working on [practice problems](/practice/1.2-practice). Answers will be posted later on that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Preliminary Math Survey Due\n\nPlease take the [preliminary survey](/assignment/00-preliminary-survey) on your math background. This will help us all have a productive semester together.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Budget Constraint for $n$ goods](/resources/appendices/1.2-appendix.html#budget-constraint-for-n-goods)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
