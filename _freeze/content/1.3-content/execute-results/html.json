We must now enter the more controversial — though still the overwhelming consensus view in economics — realm of modeling preferences.\n\nAs I mentioned in [last class' page](/content/1.2-content), a lot of the \"in the weeds\" details about preference assumptions, indifference curves, and utility functions are a waste of your time. If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of \"the fat,\" and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page. I used to spend an entire week just teaching about preferences. Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is *essential* that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\n\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n\n- **indifference curves**: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is *indifferent between* (and that give the same amount utility)\n- **utility functions**: which measure the *ordinal* (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only!\n- **marginal rate of substitution**: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual's subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: $MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 4.1-4.2 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Math Review Guide: Nonlinear Functions & Optimization ](https://micros23.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math/nonlinear.html)\n\n### Recommended\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> Munger, “What Preferences Do You Want?”](https://www.aier.org/article/what-preferences-do-you-want/)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-podcast\"></i> Econtalk Podcast: Michael Munger on Desires, Morality, and Self-Interest](https://www.econtalk.org/michael-munger-on-desires-morality-and-self-interest/)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> SMBC — Economist 2](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/economist-2)\n\nNow that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings *before* each class.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nAnswers from last class' [practice problems](/practice/1.2-practice) are posted on that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Preliminary Math Survey Answers\n\nAnswers to the [preliminary survey](/assignment/00-preliminary-survey) are posted on that page, along with survey results.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Strict vs. Weak Preferences](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#strict-vs.-weak-preferences)\n- [Assumptions of \"Well-Behaved\" Preferences](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#assumptions-of-well-behaved-preferences)\n- [Assumptions of \"Well-Behaved\" Indifference Curves](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#assumptions-of-well-behaved-indifference-curves)\n- [Steepness & Indifference Curves for Neutrals](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#steepness-indifference-curves-for-neutrals)\n- [Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities)](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#derivation-of-mrs-equation-as-ratio-of-marginal-utilities)\n- [Utility Functions and PMTs](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#utility-functions-and-pmts)\n- [Graphing Indifference Curves](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#graphing-indifference-curves)\n- [Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#utility-functions-for-perfect-substitutes)\n- [Utility Functions for Perfect Complements](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#utility-functions-for-perfect-complements)\n- [Cobb-Douglas Functions](/resources/appendices/1.3-appendix.html#cobb-douglas-functions)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
