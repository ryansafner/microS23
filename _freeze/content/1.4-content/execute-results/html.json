To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use [Lagrangian multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier) and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. [Take the full Lagrangian equation and solve for all partial derivatives, set equal to 0.] We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make a lot of intuitive sense. That rule, equivalently expressed in two ways:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} &= \\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\\\\n\\frac{MU_x}{p_x} &= \\frac{MU_y}{p_y}\\\\ \n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe first rule states that the slope of the indifference curve (left) equals the slope of the budget constraint (right). This is stating that the marginal benefit of consuming $x$ (left) equals the marginal cost (right) of consuming $y$, and that the individual is trading off $y$ for $x$ at the same rate as the market is.\n\nThe second (version of the) rule, solved for $x$ and $y$ terms on either side, shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across both (all) goods. \n\nBoth forms are often called the **equimarginal rule**, that at the optimum choice, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost (which is the marginal benefit of the next best foregone opportunity).\n\nWe will do some [practice](/practice/1.4-practice) to make sure you can solve this type of model, and then you are fully prepared for [Problem Set 1](/assignment/01-problem-set).\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 4.4-4.5 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Math Review Guide: Nonlinear Functions & Optimization ](https://micros23.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math/nonlinear.html)\n- <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-square-alt\"></i> [Math Review Guide: Exponents & Logarithms ](https://micros23.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math/exponents.html)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nToday we will be working on [practice problems](/practice/1.4-practice).
