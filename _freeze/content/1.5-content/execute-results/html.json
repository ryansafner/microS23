The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. \n\nAn individual’s **demand function** (often just called **“demand”**) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one's demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person's quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of *other* goods, and the person's income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good's price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar **demand curve** you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.\n\nToday, we look only at how changes in *income* or changes in the prices of *other* goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.\n\nIn doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an *elasticity.* You've seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the \"midpoint formula.\" There's a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nToday we will be working on [practice problems](/practice/1.5-practice).
