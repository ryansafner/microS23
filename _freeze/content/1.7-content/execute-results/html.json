We also (re-)introduce the idea of **price elasticity of demand** that measures a person's responsiveness in consumption to a change in that good's price. However, unlike what you learned in principles^[Arc-price elasticity using the midpoint between two points on the demand curve: $$\\cfrac{\\frac{q_{2}-q_{1}}{\\left(\\frac{q_{1}+q_{2}}{2}\\right)}}{\\frac{p_{2}-p_{1}}{\\left(\\frac{p_{1}+p_{2}}{2}\\right)}}$$\nThis actually calculates the elasticity of a single point, the one midway between $(q_1,p_1)$ and $(q_2,p_2)$.] we look at the elasticity of *any point on the demand curve* using a more useful formula:\n$$\\epsilon_{q,p}=\\frac{1}{slope} \\times \\frac{p}{q}$$\nwhere slope refers to the slope of the *inverse* demand curve (the one that we graph).\n\nWe will look at the key relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue, (Total expenditure, from the perspective of the buyer.) and work on some [practice problems](/practice/1.7-practice).\n\nNext class will be a review session for [Exam 1](/assignments/01-exam), and you can mind more information about on the exam that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 2.2, 2.5, 5.5, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 2 Due Monday February 20\n\n[Problem Set 2](/assignments/02-problem-set) (on classes 1.5-1.7) is due by 11:59 PM Monday February 20 on Blackboard Assignments.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
