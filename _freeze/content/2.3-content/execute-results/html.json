Again, we do not solve this constrained optimization problem with calculus, but by looking graphically, and using an algebraic rule that should make intuitive sense. \n\nAgain, these tools and rules are almost *identical* to how we solved the consumer's problem. Compare $\\frac{MP_l}{MP_k}=\\frac{w}{r}$ to $\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}=\\frac{p_x}{p_y}$ or $\\frac{MP_l}{w}=\\frac{MP_k}{r}$ to $\\frac{MU_x}{p_x} = \\frac{MU_y}{p_y}$!, with a major exception: \n\nConsumers:\n\n- choose goods to maximize utility subject to their budget constraint\n- budget constraint (line) is what is fixed\n- get on highest indifference curve tangent to budget constraint\n\nProducers (Firms):\n\n- choose inputs to minimize cost subject to producing the optimal amount (their constraint)\n- isoquant curve is what is fixed (want to produce a specific amount!)\n- get on *lowest* isocost line tangent to isoquant curve\n\nWe finally wrap up with a discussion of *returns to scale*.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 6.4-6.7 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n### Optional/Recommended Reading\n- [Increasing Returns](https://increasingreturns.substack.com) — my newsletter with the theme of increasing returns\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [A Change in Relative Factor Prices](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.html#a-change-in-relative-factor-prices)\n- [Improvements in Technology](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.html#improvements-in-technology)\n- [Returns to Scale: Proof of Exponents Trick](/resources/appendices/2.3-appendix.htmll#returns-to-scale-proof-of-exponents-trick)\n\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 3 Due Wednesday March 22\n\n[Problem Set 3](/assignments/03-problem-set) (on classes 2.1-2.3) is due by 11:59 PM Wednesday March 22 on Blackboard Assignments.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
