We also now need to talk about the fact that our firm is not the *only* profit-maximizing firm in the market, so we derive an **equilibrium** model of the industry in the long run.\n\nFamously, we see that in *competitive* industries, economic profits get driven to zero in the long run, as firms enter or exit any time there are profits or losses.\n\nWe also talk about the hard to understand, but extremely important, idea of economic rents.\n\nNext class we will have a **review session** for [**Exam 2**](/assignments/02-exam).\n\n**Update**: I have added the answers to the price elasticity of supply question [in the slides](https://microf22.classes.ryansafner.com/slides/2.6-slides.html#63) (that I had to skip for time):\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/files/practice/2.6-practice-answers.html\"><span class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\"><i class=\"far fa-life-ring\"></i> Price Elasticity of Supply Question Answers</a></span></p>\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 8.4-8.5 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nAnswers from last class' [practice problems](/practice/2.5-practice) are posted on that page.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-sigma\"></i> Appendix\n\nSee the online appendix for today's content:\n\n- [Producer Surplus](/resources/appendices/2.6-appendix.html#producer-surplus)\n- [What’s the Difference Between Producer Surplus and Profit?](/resources/appendices/2.6-appendix.html#whats-the-difference-between-producer-surplus-and-profit)\n- [Economic Rents](/resources/appendices/2.6-appendix.html#economic-rents)\n- [The Shape of the Long Run Industry Supply Curve: External Economies](/resources/appendices/2.6-appendix.html#the-shape-of-the-long-run-industry-supply-curve-external-economies)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-laptop-code\"></i> Assignments\n\n### Problem Set 4 Due Wednesday March 29\n\n[Problem Set 4](/assignments/04-problem-set) (on classes 2.4-2.6) is due by 11:59 PM Wednesday March 29 on Blackboard Assignments.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
