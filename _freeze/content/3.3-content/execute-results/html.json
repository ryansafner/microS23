We take a crack at defining efficiency in a few ways: [allocative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocative_efficiency), [productive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_efficiency), [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency), and [Kaldor-Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency) efficiency. We then discuss [Welfare Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics) and I summarize three conditions about when markets are good & efficient:\n1. Markets are competitive\n2. Markets reach equilibrium\n3. Markets do not have externalities\n\nThis leads us into a discussion of [market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), when markets *aren’t* efficient because something prevents the price system from working properly. We talk about several types of market failures: collective action problems, public goods, and externalities.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 14.2-14.7, Ch. 16 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\nYour textbook does cover efficiency and welfare economics in Chapter 14, in the context of general equilibrium theory, which is a bit too advanced for us to spend sufficient time to cover. Thus, I would not recommend reading that chapter unless you are prepared to dive into new tools (Edgeworth diagrams, production possibilities frontiers) that I will not cover in this course.\n\nChapter 16, however, is a pretty accessible discussion of externalities and public goods.\n\n### Optional/Recommended Reading\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-file-pdf\"></i> Safner, 2020, \"'Public Good,' or 'Good for the Public?'
