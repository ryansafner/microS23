Today is merely about how do change the model to understand how a firm with market power behaves. To assist us, we begin with an extreme case of a single seller, i.e. a **monopoly.** For now we only *assume* that there is a single firm, and see how it behaves differently than if it were in a competitive market. Next class we will begin to explore what could *cause* a market to have only a single seller, and what are some of the social consequences of market power.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 9-2-9.5 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-dumbbell\"></i> Practice\n\nToday we will be working on [practice problems](/practice/4.1-practice).
