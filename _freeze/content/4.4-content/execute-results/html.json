To model them, we blend elements of monopoly with elements of perfect competition. In the short-run, we model the firm as a monopoly acting like any monopolist would, but in the long run, there is **free entry and exit**, so other entrants reduce the demand for any one firm’s product (and make it more elastic) so that firms’ economic profits go to zero.\n\nWe finally cover **oligopoly**, where there are a small number of firms with market power that **interact strategically**. While some industries in the real world are indeed dominated by a small number of firms, this type of model is applicable well beyond industries with a small number of firms, as to understand the strategic nature of firm decisions, we introduce **game theory** into our models.\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-book-reader fa-lg\"></i> Readings\n\n- <i class=\"fas fas fa-book\"></i> Ch. 11 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019\n\n### Recommended Reading\n\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-podcast\"></i> *NPR Planet Money* 579: “Is the NCAA an Illegal Cartel?”](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/31/360176715/episode-579-is-the-ncaa-an-illegal-cartel)\n- [<i class=\"fas fa-podcast\"></i> *NPR Planet Money* 478: “The Raisin Outlaw”](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/06/24/417187957/episode-478-the-raisin-outlaw)\n\n## <i class=\"fas fa-chalkboard-teacher\"></i> Slides\n\nBelow, you can find the slides in two formats.
