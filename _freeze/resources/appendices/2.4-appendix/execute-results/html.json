These will be all of the tangencies for a given isoquant (output level) with the lowest possible isocost line. \n\nImportantly, we are assuming: (1) firms always minimize total cost at every level of output; and (2) input prices $w$ and $r$ do not change as the firm increases output\n\nFor a Cobb-Douglas production function, the OEP is a ray from the origin (0,0) through all the optimal combinations. Other production functions may have OEPs that are not straight lines, but curves.\n\nWe can trace the total cost function $C(q)$ for different levels of output $q$, by identifying the total cost at each optimal (cost-minimizing) combination of $L$ and $K$ for each level of $q$ (again, holding prices constant). I show this in the second graph on the right.\n\nNote here we can also visualize the differences in *returns to scale*, and begin to see their connection to economies of scale (how output relates to average cost). \n\nBelow, I show the output expansion paths and total cost functions for technology with constant returns. Note that as we double the amount of inputs from point $A$ to point $B$, we go from using 10 $L$ and 5 $K$ to produce 7.07 units of output $(\\sqrt{50})$ to using 20 $L$ and 10 $K$ to produce 14.14 units of output $(\\sqrt{200}$). This is an exact doubling of output from doubling the scale of production. Notice our total cost will also double, from $40 to $80. Thus, for constant returns, total cost increases proportionate to output.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBelow, I show the output expansion paths and total cost functions for technology with *increasing* returns. Note that as we double the amount of inputs from point $A$ to point $B$, we go from using 10 $L$ and 5 $K$ to produce 50 units of output  to using 20 $L$ and 10 $K$ to produce 200 units of output. Here we *quadruple* output from doubling the scale of production. Notice also our total cost will also increase as we increase output, but at a decreasing rate!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Marginal Cost and Variable Cost\n\nMarginal cost is defined as the change in total costs from a change in output:\n$$MC(q)=\\frac{\\Delta C(q)}{\\Delta q}$$\n\nRecall that total cost is the sum of fixed and variable costs\n\n$$C(q)=f+VC(q)$$\nHowever, since fixed costs never change, any change in total cost is a change in variable cost\n$$\\Delta C(q) = \\Delta VC(q)$$\n\nThus, marginal cost actually measures the change in *variable costs* from a change in output:\n$$MC(q)=\\frac{\\Delta C(q)}{\\Delta q}=\\frac{\\Delta VC(q)}{\\Delta q}$$\nThus, **fixed cost has no effect on marginal cost**, and **marginal cost is always measuring the change in variable costs** with additional output.\n\nFurthermore, because of this relationship with marginal cost measuring the change in variable cost from additional output, for any specific quantity of output, e.g. $q_1$, the variable cost of producing $q_1$ can be seen on the graph below as the total area under the marginal cost curve to the left of $q_1$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The Relationship Between Returns to Scale and Costs\n\nThere is a direct relationship between a technology's returns to scale^[Increasing, decreasing, or constant] and its cost structure: the rate at which its total costs increase^[At a decreasing rate, at an increasing rate, or at a constant rate, respectively] and its marginal costs change^[Decreasing, increasing, or constant, respectively]. This is easiest to see for a single input, such as our assumptions of the short run (where firms can change $l$ but not $\\bar{k})$:\n\n$$q=f(\\bar{k},l)$$\n\n### Constant Returns to Scale: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Decreasing Returns to Scale\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Increasing Returns to Scale\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Cobb-Douglas Cost Functions\n\nThe total cost function for Cobb-Douglas production functions of the form\n$$q=l^{\\alpha}k^{\\beta}$$\ncan be shown with some *very tedious* algebra to be:\n\n$$C(w,r,q)=\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{-\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\right] w^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}} r^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}} q^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}}$$\n\nIf you take the first derivative of this (to get marginal cost), it is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial C(w,r,q)}{\\partial q}= MC(q) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\left(w^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}} r^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\right) q^{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)-1}$$\n\nHow does marginal cost change with increased output? Take the second derivative:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 C(w,r,q)}{\\partial q^2}= \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} -1 \\right) \\left(w^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}} r^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\right) q^{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)-2}$$\n\nThree possible cases:\n\n1. If $\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} > 1$, this is positive $\\implies$ **_decreasing_ returns to scale**\n  - Production function exponents $\\alpha+\\beta < 1$\n2. If $\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} < 1$, this is negative $\\implies$ **_increasing_ returns to scale**\n  - Production function exponents $\\alpha+\\beta > 1$\n3. If $\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} = 1$, this is constant $\\implies$ **_constant_ returns to scale**\n  - Production function exponents $\\alpha+\\beta = 1$\n\n#### Example (Constant Returns)\n\nLet $q=l^{0.5}k^{0.5}$. \n\n\\begin{align*}\nC(w,r,q)&=\\left[\\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\right)^{\\frac{0.5}{0.5+0.5}} + \\left(\\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\right)^{\\frac{-0.5}{0.5+0.5}}\\right] w^{\\frac{0.5}{0.5+0.5}} r^{\\frac{0.5}{0.5+0.5}} q^{\\frac{1}{0.5+0.5}}\\\\\nC(w,r,q)&= \\left[1^{0.5}+1^{-0.5} \\right]w^{0.5}r^{0.5}q^{0.5}\\\\\nC(w,r,q)&= w^{0.5}r^{0.5}q^{1}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nConsider input prices of $w=\\$9$ and $r=\\$25$: \n\n\\begin{align*}C(w=9,r=25,q)&=9^{0.5}25^{0.5}q \\\\ \n& =3*5*q\\\\\n& =15q\\\\\\end{align*}\n\nThat is, total costs (at those given input prices, and technology) is equal to 15 times the output level, $q$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMarginal costs would be\n\n$$MC(q) = \\frac{\\partial C(q)}{\\partial q} = 15$$\n\nAverage costs would be\n\n$$MC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q} = \\frac{15q}{q} = 15$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Example (Decreasing Returns)\n\nLet $q=l^{0.25}k^{0.25}$. \n\n\\begin{align*}\nC(w,r,q)&=\\left[\\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.25}\\right)^{\\frac{0.25}{0.25+0.25}} + \\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.25}\\right)^{\\frac{-0.25}{0.25+0.25}}\\right] w^{\\frac{0.25}{0.25+0.25}} r^{\\frac{0.25}{0.25+0.25}} q^{\\frac{1}{0.25+0.25}}\\\\\nC(w,r,q)&= \\left[1^{0.5}+1^{-0.5} \\right]w^{0.5}r^{0.5}q^{2}\\\\\nC(w,r,q)&= w^{0.5}r^{0.5}q^{2}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf $w=9$, $r=25$: \n\n\\begin{align*}C(w=9,r=25,q)&=9^{0.5}25^{0.5}q^2 \\\\ \n& =3*5*q^2\\\\\n& =15q^2\\\\\\end{align*}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMarginal costs would be\n\n$$MC(q) = \\frac{\\partial C(q)}{\\partial q} = 30q$$\n\nAverage costs would be\n\n$$AC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q} = \\frac{15q^2}{q} = 15q$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.4-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::",
