This also makes graphs quite easy to point to and calculate key areas, such as profits or deadweight losses.\n\nOne common set of cost assumptions is the following:\n\n1. A firm has no fixed costs\n2. A firm has constant marginal costs, $MC(q)=c$ where $c\\geq0$\n\nIf this is the case, then we can show that average costs will be *equal* to marginal costs, i.e. $MC=AC=AVC=c$. \n\nSince marginal cost is the first derivative of the total cost function, integrating a marginal cost function $MC=c$ leaves with with a total cost function of $C(q)=cq$.^[Since we assumed there are no fixed costs, then there is no arbitrary constant from integration.] If this is the case, then we can find the average cost: \n\n\\begin{align*}\nC(q)&=cq\\\\\nAC(q)=\\frac{C(q)}{q}&=\\frac{cq}{q}\\\\\nAC(q)&=c\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.5-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother common set of cost assumptions is the following:\n\n1. A firm has fixed costs, $f$\n2. A firm has constant marginal costs, $MC(q)=c$ where $c\\geq0$\n\nIf this is the case, then we can show that average costs are strictly decreasing over all output $q\\geq0$.\n\nAgain, we can integrate marginal cost to the total cost function (but here we need the arbitrary constant from integration, which we shall label $f$, for fixed costs): $C(q)=cq+f$. We can then find the average cost: \n\n\\begin{align*}\nC(q)&=cq+f\\\\\nAC(q)=\\frac{C(q)}{q}&=\\frac{cq+f}{q}\\\\\nAC(q)&=c+\\frac{f}{q}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $f>0$, as $q \\rightarrow \\infty$, $AC(q) \\rightarrow c$, that is, average cost is getting asymptotically close to marginal cost, $c$, but will never intersect it. Note, I also included AFC, which again is always decreasing, and asymptotically approaching 0. \n\nThe importance of this type of cost structure is that it creates **economies of scale**, and represents a lot of industries that tend towards **natural monopoly**. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.5-appendix_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
