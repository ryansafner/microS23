    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nYour task is to write an Opinion-Editorial (Op-ed) piece that applies the economic way of thinking to some public policy-relevant issue. An op-ed is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a writer who is unaffiliated with the newspaper or its editorial board. Often, the writer of an op-ed has no journalism experience, or (as you will soon discover), little understanding of economics. Thus, you are at no disadvantage as a student just beginning your experience with economics and writing! To get an idea, look at any newspaper’s “Opinion” section on their website or in print.\nThe purpose of this assignment is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate to you that economics is a wonderful way of thinking about any social issue, (2) for you to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (3) to develop your writing and argumentative skills, and (4) to help you develop, change, and/or strengthen your own views by grappling with them in writing.\nIn general, am looking for a short paper that puts forth an argument and defends it. You should be able to summarize your position in one sentence – the thesis of your paper that you will argue for. It should be a reasonably original argument (it is difficult with limited knowledge to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. It should use some principle(s) or insight(s) from (micro) economics to bolster your conclusions.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. Both to disincentivize procrastination, and because I have no time to read 100 papers right before the end of class, I will stop reading and commenting on drafts after April 28\nIf you publish your op-ed in any media outlet (newspapers, news websites, major blogs) by the end of the semester, you will earn extra credit according to the following scale:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication\nExamples\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nHood-affiliated outlet\nThe Blue and Grey, Professors’ blogs\n10\n\n\nLocal/regional Newspaper\nFrederick News-Post\n20\n\n\nNational Newspaper/blog\nNY Times, WaPo, WSJ, USA Today, HuffPo\n40\n\n\n\nMeeting the market test is what matters most!\nYour Op-Ed, with a word count, is due by 11:59 PM Monday December 6, via Chalk-and-Wire upload, and constitutes 20% of your final course grade."

    "section": "Length, References, & Mechanics",
    "text": "Length, References, & Mechanics\nThe goal of any op-ed is to convince reasonably-educated readers of some particular conclusion (also known as a thesis). This conclusion is of course, the opinion of the author, but this opinion must be backed by theory and evidence that leads reasonable people to agree with that conclusion. The claim you make as your conclusion should be relevant, debatable, testable, and provide new insight on a topic. Telling the reader “people who do not recycle are selfish” is neither informative nor persuasive, but telling the reader “recycling reduces the amount of trash going into local landfills by X tons a year” is at least informative, if not also persuasive. You are free to take any position on any issue that you choose, so long as it is backed by evidence and sound use of the economic way of thinking. For more details, see my presentation slides linked above.\nI always hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers A and B say the same thing, but paper B says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper B is a better paper. In any event, this assignment will largely follow the style of most major newspapers. Your op-ed must be between 500 and 1000 words. You must include a word count with your final copy. There are no other formal requirements but, I recommend formatting it in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial font, double spaced, just to make it easier for me to read (and nearly every other paper you write will ask for this).\nWhile this is not a research paper, I do want you to include some scholarly sources – for example, if you cite the work of an economist on the issue, or if you use statistics, data, or facts (which you should!). While newspapers do not publish a bibliography for each op-ed, they will scrutinize every empirical claim and ask the author for sources to back it up. Thus, I would like a list of sources you used for your article, and expect you to have at least 1-3, depending on your topic and argument. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format this list, just please be consistent. Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested style."

    "text": "Suggested Topics\nRemember that economics is a way of analyzing the world, rather than a narrow domain of topics for studying. Thus, while you may certainly write about the typical “mundane” topics of economics we often think about (money, monopoly, inflation, etc), I strongly encourage you to apply economics to something you find much more interesting about the world - from corruption in FIFA, to the constitutional political economy of pirates, to bitcoin displacing currencies, to the illegal downloading of Game of Thrones, to the cultural institutions of the Jersey Shore, to the monopoly power of the WWE in wrestling, to the relationship of Uber & Airbnb to taxis and hotels, to the privatization of asteroids, to the economics of crowdfunding, to drugs, sex, and rock n roll. In fact, it is often those topics that are most eccentric and “out in left field” that make the best op-eds!\nThere are plenty of issues around us, both immediate and visible (racism and policing, college costs, ISIS, planned parenthood, gun control, etc) and latent long term issues (monetary policy and interest rates, the drug war, government spending and debt, science funding, etc).\nThe scope of topics allowed for your paper is anything that uses the economic way of thinking to make some sort of conclusion. This is an extremely wide scope, but here are a few main types of op-eds that will tend to result from this, along with some great examples of op-eds that use economics to reach an interesting or provocative conclusion.\n\nTaking a stand on a position, either actively being discussed in the news, or a long-standing underlying issue\n\n\nThe Case for Getting Rid of Borders - Completely (The Atlantic)\nThe Racial Reality of Policing (Wall Street Journal)\nZoning Out the Poor (Washington Post)\nThis Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel (Wall Street Journal)\nHow to Save Detroit (Wall Street Journal)\nIn an Uber World, Fortune Favors the Freelancer (New York Times)\nWhat the West Gets Wrong About Russia (New York Times)\n\n\nCriticizing recent statements, current popular fallacies, or policy proposals of others in the news\n\n\nShut Up Royal Baby Haters, Monarchy is Awesome (Washington Post)\nTrump’s Protectionist Fallacies Have Been Refuted By Free Market Economists for Hundreds of Years (Huffington Post)\nTrump’s Exploits Rational Ignorance (USA Today)\nBernie Sanders on Immigrants: Silly, Tribal and Economically Illiterate (Newsweek)\nThe Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class (Wall Street Journal)\nThe ‘77 cents on the Dollar’ Myth About Women’s Pay (Wall Street Journal)\nHow Everyone Gets the Sharing Economy Wrong (Wall Street Journal)\nWhy Bill Gates Hates my Book (Wall Street Journal)\nIn Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions (New York Times)\n\n\nProviding new insight into a social phenomenon that is interesting or novel, designed to get people talking\n\n\nDriven to Kill: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians they Hit (Slate)\nThe Case for the City-State (Wall Street Journal)\nWhat Hollywood Can Teach Us About the Future of Work (New York Times)\nLosing is Good for You (New York Times)\nThe $250 Econ 101 Textbook (Wall Street Journal)\nCash for Kidneys: The Case for a Market for Organs (Wall Street Journal)\nThe Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source (Wired)\nShould Physician Pay Be Tied to Performance?

Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate?\nClarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples?\nOrganization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding?\nReferences: Does your paper use multiple reputable references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section?\nStyle: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice?

While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about any decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as “Rational Choice Theory”. This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of constrained optimization, so today we are only focusing on the constraints using the tool known as the “budget constraint.”\nWhile budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most “alien” material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It’s perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.1"

We must now enter the more controversial — though still the overwhelming consensus view in economics — realm of modeling preferences.\nAs I mentioned in last class’ page, a lot of the “in the weeds” details about preference assumptions, indifference curves, and utility functions are a waste of your time. If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of “the fat,” and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page. I used to spend an entire week just teaching about preferences. Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is essential that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n\nindifference curves: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is indifferent between (and that give the same amount utility)\nutility functions: which measure the ordinal (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only!\nmarginal rate of substitution: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual’s subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: \\(MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}\\)"

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nToday we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer’s constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use Lagrangian multipliers and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. [Take the full Lagrangian equation and solve for all partial derivatives, set equal to 0.] We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make a lot of intuitive sense. That rule, equivalently expressed in two ways:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} &= \\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\\\\n\\frac{MU_x}{p_x} &= \\frac{MU_y}{p_y}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\] The first rule states that the slope of the indifference curve (left) equals the slope of the budget constraint (right). This is stating that the marginal benefit of consuming \\(x\\) (left) equals the marginal cost (right) of consuming \\(y\\), and that the individual is trading off \\(y\\) for \\(x\\) at the same rate as the market is.\nThe second (version of the) rule, solved for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms on either side, shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across both (all) goods.\nBoth forms are often called the equimarginal rule, that at the optimum choice, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost (which is the marginal benefit of the next best foregone opportunity).\nWe will do some practice to make sure you can solve this type of model, and then you are fully prepared for Problem Set 1."

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nSolving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the dynamics of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income.\nAn individual’s demand function (often just called “demand”) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one’s demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person’s quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of other goods, and the person’s income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good’s price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar demand curve you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.\nToday, we look only at how changes in income or changes in the prices of other goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.\nIn doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an elasticity. You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now."

    "text": "Interactive Examples\n\nVisualizing the Consumer’s Problem\nVisualizing Changes in the Consumer’s Problem\nVisualizing Demand Shifters\n\nThese are examples that I wrote in R/Shiny in the past, to visualize what it is we are looking at. As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.\nThe first is a visual example of the static (one-time) Consumer’s problem. You can adjust things about the (Cobb-Douglas) utility function, income, and prices, and see how it would affect the graph and the optimum.\nThe second is a visual example of dynamic changes in the Consumer’s problem. The consumer starts at a pre-defined optimum. You can adjust any of the budget constraint parameters \\((m, p_x, p_y)\\), and see how it would affect a new optimum, which you can compare the the original optimum.\nThe third is a visual example of a hypothetical demand function for beer, with preference intensity, income, price of nachos (a complement), and price of wine (a substitute) as inputs to the function. Based on some pre-defined functions (in the background), you can change any of the inputs and see how it would affect the (inverse) demand function, expressed as a simple demand curve.\nI hope some time to clean these up and make a few more, such as “Visualizing the Income and Substitution Effects” and “Estimating a Demand Function from Real World Data.”"

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nToday we wrap up Unit 1 by talking more extensively about demand curves and simple demand functions (relating price and quantity demanded of a good, ceterus paribus). We also (re-)introduce the idea of price elasticity of demand that measures a person’s responsiveness in consumption to a change in that good’s price. However, unlike what you learned in principles1 we look at the elasticity of any point on the demand curve using a more useful formula: \\[\\epsilon_{q,p}=\\frac{1}{slope} \\times \\frac{p}{q}\\] where slope refers to the slope of the inverse demand curve (the one that we graph).\nWe will look at the key relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue, (Total expenditure, from the perspective of the buyer.) and work on some practice problems.\nNext class will be a review session for Exam 1, and you can mind more information about on the exam that page."

You will ultimately see, we will use the same tools (and get basically the same results!) for studying producers (constrained optimization models) as we did for consumers. Sometimes, these models finally “click” for students the second time around, and production is often more intuitive than utility and consumption.\nToday we set up the problem, and discuss what it is that firms do. If you want to learn a lot more about the economics of organization and theory of the firm, see my Industrial Organization class.\nIn the beginning, I introduce the canonical model of comparative advantage as a way to explore a lot of insights about production, the division of labor, specialization and trade, and the theory of the firm. Do not get too distracted in the graphs or mechanics of this model (though it should echo things that we have seen before), it is only a useful segue for what we will cover in the next 2-3 weeks. If you want to know more, I do a deep dive with these models to explain international trade in ECON 324."

    "text": "Overview\nToday we continue with setting up the second stage of the firm’s problem, the cost-minimization problem, where firms choose inputs \\((l,k)\\) that minimize total cost \\((wl+rk)\\) in order to produce the optimal amount of output \\(q^*\\). For now, we are merely assuming the amount of output that is optimal, later we will explicitly solve for it as our first stage (profit maximization problem).\nIn doing so, we need to split up production activity into the short-run, where firms cannot change all inputs (we traditionally assume capital is fixed \\(\\bar{k}\\) and firms can only change labor \\(l)\\), and the long run, where firms can change all inputs. We discuss short run production and associated input-based metrics: marginal product and average product.\nIn the long-run, firms can choose many combinations of inputs \\((l,k)\\) that yield a desired output. We introduce two tools that will remind you a lot like the tools from consumer theory: (1) an isoquant curve1 that, similar to an indifference curve, contains all the combinations of inputs that yield the same output, and (2) an isocost line2 that, similar to a budget constraint, contains all the combinations of inputs that are the same total cost. We discuss some properties about each of these things and do some examples in anticipation of putting these tools together in the next class to solve the problem.\nFor some students, it takes this second time around with the tools of consumer theory for them to finally “click,” and that’s okay!"

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nToday we consider how markets work and why (and when) they are so efficient at allocating resources and solving social problems. We take a crack at defining efficiency in a few ways: allocative, productive, Pareto, and Kaldor-Hicks efficiency. We then discuss Welfare Economics and I summarize three conditions about when markets are good & efficient: 1. Markets are competitive 2. Markets reach equilibrium 3. Markets do not have externalities\nThis leads us into a discussion of market failure, when markets aren’t efficient because something prevents the price system from working properly. We talk about several types of market failures: collective action problems, public goods, and externalities."

    "text": "Overview\nToday we discuss how markets work in real life, and what prices actually do, and why we need them to coordinate economic activity.\nThis is hands down my favorite lecture to give every semester, and arguably the most important one, since we focus on reading “between the lines” of the fictional models we construct (supply and demand, perfect competition, etc.) and what happens in real world markets. All too often, people learn the models of basic economics and make one of the following mistakes:\n\nThey see the real world looking nothing like the model, and conclude the model is useless.\nThey see the real world looking nothing like the model, and conclude the real world is wrong and must be fixed to work like the model works.\nThey believe the model to be a 100% accurate description of the real world.\n\nI will argue, over the remainder of the semester, that despite the flaws in these models, they are still useful for understanding and explaining how the real world works."

Hence, I have tried to give you some well-known readings\nKnight’s (1920) book is the most famous discussion of the perfect competition model, and how real world competition differs from the model because of uncertainty, which gives rise to the possibility of positive profit in the real world.\nHayek (1945) is one of the most famous papers in economics, arguing how the economy is not a constrained optimization problem, and that central planning faces an enormous knowledge problem, as prices are needed to tap into the fragmented, tacit knowledge dispersed across individuals (that no single person or entity can know) to coordinate the behavior of millions of people.\nAlchian (1950) argues that the behavioral assumption of firms maximizing profits is incorrect, because there is no way anything can be maximized in a world of uncertainty (see Knight). It is better to view market competition in evolutionary terms, firms survive simply by earning positive profits (rather than maximum profits) by best adapting to the competitive environment — whether by intention and skill, or by sheer luck: “Even in a world of stupid men there would be profits.”\nThe video lecture by Gerd Gigerenzer provides a more modern approach to understanding how to model the world under uncertainty: that it is impossible to optimize, but instead to use heuristics. This stands as a strong criticism of behavioral economics (which focuses on the supposed irrationality of decision-making).\nSimilarly, Smith’s (2003) Nobel Prize article discusses this.\nFinally, the two videos “What if There Were No Prices” and “Mises vs. Marx” are the best way to understand what was known as the “Socialist Calculation Debate” in the 1920s-1940s: can we centrally plan an economy? I cover this debate more extensively in two of my other classes (see links to ECON 317 and ECON 452)."

    "section": " Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWe have seen that markets can fail under a variety of circumstances, and have suggested that government intervention can improve upon the sub-optimal outcome for society. However, just because markets may fail does not mean that government cannot also fail!\nWe explore some examples of how governments contribute to disequilibrium and harmful outcomes by trying to intervene in markets and creating inefficiencies (through means such as price controls, taxes, and various regulations). For brevity and relevance, we focus on one set of examples: price-gouging laws and supply restrictions & regulations in the era of COVID.\nWe extend this to a broader discussion of the role of social, political, and economic institutions in determining outcomes. In order to fairly assess outcomes, we must examine the institutions and incentives that people face, leading to various consequences (rather than necessarily blaming the people or some behavioral motivation). We also need to avoid commiting the “nirvana fallacy” of comparing an imperfect system we see in reality with a hypothetical perfect system we can envision. This becomes an empirical question of comparing which systems fail the least (or are most robust) in practice.\nLastly, depending on time, we may briefly explore the field of economics known as “public choice” — applying economic tools to understand politics by modeling it as equilibria determined by the interactions between various optimizing agents. For a full course on this, see my ECON 410 — Public Economics"

This work by him is a good summary of the economic analysis of politics using basic principles we use to study markets: equilibrium resulting from exchanges and interactions between optimizing individuals pursuing their own interests.\nThe second paper by William Baumol (who, if he lived longer, might have won the Nobel prize — he definitely earned one) is one of my favorite papers that I love to teach in classes that cover political economy. Everyone tries to better themselves, and entrepreneurship is a fundamental force in human society, the differences in outcome come from the institutions that channel entrepreneurship into productive, unproductive, or destructive outcomes.\nThe last two podcasts are helpful for discussing the failures, largely of government policy, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic."

In fact, many of these assumptions are derived from the assumptions we made above about well-behaved preferences\n\nWe can always draw indifference curves: two bundles can always be ranked\n\nEvery possible bundle (point on graph) is on an indifference curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this means that this entire graph is full of indifference curves - every single possible point is on some indifference curve (and this whole graph would just be a solid block of black). Naturally, it’s pointless to draw all the indifference curves, we just want to show a few to make our analysis meaningful. But the general idea comes from assumption 2 of preferences: any two bundles can be compared, as we can compare two points on this graph and make a judgment.\n\nIndifference curves are monotonic, which means practically that “more is preferred to less”\n\nFor any bundle \\(b\\) with more of at least one good than bundle \\(a \\implies a \\prec b\\). Movements to the Northeast always preferable, while movements to the Southwest always unpreferable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a challenge: what would indifference curves look like if one of the axes contained a bad, rather than a good? In this case, we would violate the assumption of monotonicity!\n\nIndifference curves are convex, which means in practice that “averages are preferred to extremes”\n\nFrom experience, people generally prefer variety in their consumption. Rather than having one bundle that is “extreme” (a lot of one good and little or none of another), they tend to prefer a bundle with a better “mix” or “balance” of some of both goods.\nTake our example from class, hunting for apartments. Apartment \\(A\\) is very large but near very few friends, whereas apartment \\(B\\) is very small but near many friends. If we could find some apartment, \\(C\\), that is a weighted average of the two, with a better mix of size and friends, it would be preferred, and thus, on a higher indifference curve than \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)!\nMathematically, this feature is because indifference curves are normally convex. A function is convex when a line connecting any two points on the function lies above the function itself. Check the math review guide for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a challenge: what would non-convex (e.g. concave) curves look like, and what preferences would cause that situation?\n\nIndifference curves can never cross because we have assumed that preferences are transitive.\n\nSuppose two curves crossed, as the ones below:\n\nOn the blue indifference curve, \\(A \\sim B\\)\nOn the orange indifference curve \\(B \\sim C\\)\nBut clearly \\(C \\succ B\\)\nPreferences are not transitive!"

However, this appendix shows that the problem can be solved in a single stage. For simplicity, we look at the short run, where there is a single input \\(l\\) that can be chosen \\((\\bar{k}\\) is fixed).\nThe firm’s profit maximization problem:\n\nChoose: \\(<\\) Input and Output: \\(l,q\\) \\(>\\)\nTo Maximize: \\(<\\) Profit: \\(\\pi=pq-wl\\) \\(>\\)\nSubject to: \\(<\\) Technology: \\(q=f(\\bar{k},l)\\) \\(>\\)\nWritten mathematically: \\[\\max_{l,q \\geq 0}pq-wl\\] \\[s.t. q=f(\\bar{k},l)\\]\n\n\nObjective: Maximize Profits\nThe objective function is trying to maximize profits. So we need to think about different levels (“contour lines”) of profit that correspond to combinations of input and output (at constant prices).1\nA firm earns profits (\\(\\pi\\)) as revenues minus costs: \\[\\pi=pq-wl\\] Where - \\(q\\): quantity of output - \\(p\\): price of output - \\(w\\): price of input (wage) - \\(l\\): quantity of input (labor)\nImagine different amounts of input and output that would generate the same profit. We can think of an isoprofit line as having the equation above.\n\n\n\nHowever, it’s easier if we graph it as output in terms of input (our two axes for drawing the production function): \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\pi &=pq-wl\\\\\n\\pi+wl&=pq\\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{p}+\\frac{w}{p}l&=q\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor these example isoprofit lines, since the price of our input \\((w)\\) is $1, and the price of output \\((p)\\) is $2, the slope of each of the isoprofit lines is positive \\(0.5\\).\n\n\nConstraint: Technology\nThe constraint is what is technologically feasible for the firm to produce, according to its production function. We need to make a few assumptions about production functions in order to get an optimum solution:\n\n\\(q>0\\): firms always produce a positive amount\n\\(\\frac{dq}{d l}>0\\): The more inputs used, the more output produced (the marginal product, i.e. the slope of production function, i.e. it’s first derivative, is positive)\n\\(\\frac{d^2q}{d l^2}<0\\): Diminishing marginal productivity (production increases at a decreasing rate, i.e. the second derivative of the production function is negative)\n\nThese assumptions generate decreasing returns to scale in production: doubling input produces less than double output. These assumptions give us a mathematically-easy answer to find, but not all production fits these assumptions. A production function that fits these assumptions would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the Problem\nEssentially, we are trying to find the highest profit line tangent to our production function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a tangency, the slopes of the two functions are equal. The slope of the isoprofit lines we know are \\(\\frac{w}{p}\\). The slope of the production function is the marginal product (of labor). So at the point of tangency: \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{Slope of production function} &= \\text{Slope of Isoprofit line}\\\\\n    \\mathbf{MP_l}&\\mathbf{=\\frac{w}{p}}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]"

    "section": "The Geometry of Short-Run Production",
    "text": "The Geometry of Short-Run Production\nThis appendix explores the geometry of production functions in the short run. From the common law of diminishing returns (sometimes called “the law of variable proportions”), with constant technology, increasing the use of one factor (e.g. \\(l)\\), holding other factors constant (e.g. \\(\\bar{k})\\), will ultimately experience diminishing returns. We often break up short-run production into three stages, based on the type of returns to increasing the use of one factor: increasing, decreasing, and negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI. Increasing Returns\nIn Stage I, labor experiences increasing returns. Both the marginal and the average product of labor are positive and (mostly) increasing. That is to say, output is increasing at an increasing rate when more labor is added, and the productivity per worker increases. For the example above, Stage I occurs over the range of 0-6 workers.\nIntuitively, increasing returns means that output increases at an increasing rate. This is not the same, but you can think of this almost like exponential growth – just by adding a few more units of input we can get massive amounts of output. If this held forever, we could grow the entire world’s supply of food in a single flower pot!\nNote that at 4 workers, marginal product reaches a maximum. Beyond this point, marginal product remains positive but begins to decrease. Looking at the production function, at 4 workers, the production function is at an inflection point. After 4 workers, the production function continues to increase, but now at a decreasing rate.\nGeometrically, what this means is that between 0-4 workers, the production function is convex (a line connecting two points is above the function), between 4-6 workers, the production function is concave (a line connecting two points is below the function), the inflection point at 4 is where it switches between convex and concave.\nStage I ends not at 4 laborers, where marginal product is maximized, but at 6 workers, where the marginal product and average product intersect (are equal).\nIn practice, most firms breeze through Stage I very quickly. Naturally, if firms can boost output a lot, and cheaply, just by adding a worker or two, they will keep hiring workers and hiring workers…\n\n\nII. Decreasing Returns\nIn Stage II, labor experiences diminishing returns. As we discussed with the law of diminishing returns, this will eventually happen to all factors of production if you keep adding them (holding other factors constant). Now, output is increasing, but at a decreasing rate. Adding more workers will increase output, but by progressively less and less, and each worker also is less productive on average, since both average and marginal product is declining (though total product is increasing). For the example above, Stage II occurs over the range of 6-8 workers.\nStage II ends at 8 workers, where the marginal product falls to zero.\nIn practice, most firms operate in Stage II, so this range is sometimes called the ``economic region’’ of short run production. We have seen that it is in the interest of a firm to keep adding labor during Stage I. We will next see that it is disadvantageous for a firm to keep adding labor beyond Stage II. Hence, the optimal amount of labor is often somewhere in Stage II.\n\n\nIII. Negative Returns\nIn Stage III, labor experiences negative returns, that is, adding labor actually decreases output! Here we have the “too many cooks in the kitchen” phenomenon. For the example above, Stage III happens when the firm is using 8 or more workers. We can see that the marginal product is negative, and average product continues to decline, as does output.\nRecall diminishing returns implies that we are adding labor but holding all other factors (e.g. capital) constant. It is possible to increase the number of workers beyond 8 and still increase output, but that would require an increase in capital. If we do not increase capital, then by continually adding labor we will eventually hit diminishing (and negative) returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\nOutput\n\\(MP_l\\)\n\\(AP_l\\)\n\n\n\n\nI\n\\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\uparrow\\) rate, then \\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\downarrow\\) rate\n\\(\\uparrow\\), then \\(\\downarrow\\)\n\\(\\uparrow\\)\n\n\nII\n\\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\downarrow\\) rate\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\nIII\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\nNegative\n\\(\\downarrow\\)"

    "text": "The Relationship Between Marginal and Average\nThere is a consistent relationship between any marginal magnitude and any average magnitude. We will see this when we talk about production, about costs, revenues, profits, etc.\nWhen the marginal is greater than the average, the average is increasing because the marginal “pulls up” the average. When the marginal is less than the average, the average is decreasing because the marginal “pulls down” the average. Therefore, average is neither increasing nor decreasing (reaches a maximum/minimum) when the marginal equals the average.\nThink of your grades or your GPA. Suppose your average is a B, and you get back a (marginal) grade that is an A. Since the marginal is higher than the average, this pulls up your average. Suppose instead you get back a (marginal) grade that is a C. Since the marginal is lower than the average, this pulls down your average.\n\n\n\nCase\n\\(AP_l\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(MP_l > AP_l\\)\n\\(\\uparrow\\)\n\n\n\\(MP_l = AP_l\\)\nMaximized\n\n\n\\(MP_l < AP_l\\)\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\nLook at the lower panel of the figure above and you can see, in Stage I, \\(MP_l>AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) is increasing. The transition to Stage II occurs where \\(MP_l=AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) reaches its maximum. In Stage III, \\(MP_l<AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) is falling.\nIf these graphs looks vaguely familiar, cost curves (total cost, marginal cost, average cost) are monetized reciprocals of product curves (total product, marginal product, average product). Here is a proof (that will make sense a few lessons from now):\n\\[MC(q)  = \\frac{ \\partial VC(q)}{\\partial q} = w \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q}= w \\frac{1}{MP_l}\\]\n\\[\nAVC(q) = \\frac{ \\partial VC}{\\partial q} = w \\frac{l}{q}= w \\frac{1}{AP_l}\n\\]\n\nElasticity of Substitution\nHow easy is it to substitute between labor and capital (or any inputs)? Along a single isoquant, the rate of technical substitution (MRTS) will diminish as we move to the right (more labor, less capital, i.e. the capital/labor ratio, \\(\\frac{k}{l}\\) decreases). The elasticity of substitution (often written \\(\\sigma)\\), measures the degree of responsiveness: \\[\\sigma=\\cfrac{\\% \\Delta \\left(\\frac{k}{l}\\right)}{\\% \\Delta MRTS}=\\cfrac{\\% \\Delta \\left(\\frac{k}{l}\\right)}{\\% \\Delta \\frac{MP_L}{MP_K}}\\]\nWe can measure the elasticity of substitution \\(\\sigma\\) for four common types of production functions: 1. Linear production functions \\((\\sigma=\\infty)\\) \\[q=f(l,k)=\\alpha k+\\beta l\\] 2. Fixed proportions (i.e. perfect complements, known as “Leontief” production functions): \\(\\sigma=0\\) \\[q=\\min\\{\\alpha k, \\beta l\\} \\quad \\alpha, \\beta >0 \\] 3. Cobb-Douglas (\\(\\sigma = 1)\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\nq=f(k,l)&=Ak^\\alpha l^\\beta \\\\\nf(tk,tl) &= A(tk)^\\alpha (tl)^\\beta \\\\\n&= At^{\\alpha + \\beta}k^\\alpha l ^\\beta \\\\\n&=t^{\\alpha+\\beta}Ak^\\alpha l^\\beta \\\\\n&=t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(k,l)\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nHence, if \\(\\alpha+\\beta=1\\) (constant returns to scale),\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function: \\[q=f(k,l)=[k^\\rho + l^\\rho]^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\rho}}\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma=\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\\) - For \\(\\gamma >1\\): increasing returns - For \\(\\gamma <1\\): decreasing returns\nIncorporates all three previous cases: 1. Linear: \\(\\rho=1\\)\n\\[[k + l]^{\\gamma}\\]\n\nFixed proportions: \\(\\rho = -\\infty\\)\n\n\\[[k^{-\\infty} + l^{-\\infty}]^{\\frac{\\gamma}{-\\infty}}\\]\n\nCobb-Douglas: \\(\\rho=0\\)\n\n\\[[k^{0} + l^{0}]^{\\frac{\\gamma}{0}}\\]"

How does it affect the cost-minimizing (optimal) combination of inputs?\nIt turns out, a change in one input’s price relative to the other is likely to change the ratio of inputs, as well as the total cost of production due to the mathematics and geometry of cost minimization. Recall the cost-minimizing combination of inputs occurs where the slope of the isoquant is equal to the slope of the lowest isocost line tangent to the isoquant. In the graph below, this occurs at point \\(A\\).\nThen, suppose the price of labor \\(w\\) increases from $2 to $4. This causes a move along the isoquant from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the firm substitutes more capital for labor, and this costs more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the optimal isocost line rotate along both axes (i.e. both axis-endpoints change)? With the budget constraint, we saw a change in one price caused the budget constraint to rotate and change an endpoint only along the axis with the good that changed in price.\nHere, recall that the isoquant is unmovable - this is the set optimal quantity we want to produce. If an input were to change in price, that would rotate the isocost line and change only the intercept of that input that changed in price, as with a budget constraint. However, that new line (dashed darker red line) would not be tangent to our original budget constraint anymore - that is, we could not produce the output we want at the same total cost as before. Thus, it must be on a new isocost line (indicating a different total cost), just with the same slope as the new isocost line after the price change.\nNote you could also go in the other direction. Begin at point \\(B\\) and suppose the price of labor decreases (or perhaps the price of capital increases). Then, the firm will substitute more labor for capital, and this will cost less!"

    "text": "Producer Surplus\nYou may recall from principles of microeconomics the concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus in markets. While we will study them in our next unit with Supply & Demand, we can talk about the producer surplus to each firm here.\nProducer surplus essentially measures the “gains from exchange” to each party — for a producer, it is how much they benefit (on net) from selling their output.\nThere are three equivalent ways of visualizing and measuring producer surplus for a firm. I will begin with a generalized series of cost curves:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese often converge, and are also easier to identify when marginal cost is linear (and thus, average variable cost is also linear, and starts at the same point as marginal cost, the shutdown price). Here it producer surplus becomes the familiar “triangle” between the market price and the supply curve. Note we can also calculate it as the rectangle of revenues minus variable costs (right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Producer Surplus and Profit?\nProducer surplus (PS) looks a lot like profits \\((\\pi)\\), but they are in fact different:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n                    \\color{red}{PS} &= R(q) - VC\\\\  \n                    & \\\\\n\\color{green}{\\pi} & = R(q) - C(q) \\\\\n\\color{green}{\\pi} &= R(q) - VC(q)-f\\\\  \n                    & \\\\\n\\color{green}{\\pi}-\\color{red}{PS}&=-f\\\\\n\\color{green}{\\pi}&=\\color{red}{PS}-f\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nProducer surplus does not include fixed costs \\((f)\\), but profit \\((\\pi)\\) does.\nIf there are no fixed costs, then producer surplus and profits are the same thing.\nThis leads to some other implications connected with the shutdown condition \\(p<AVC(q)\\). A firm will always earn producer surplus, but may earn losses (negative profit) so long as the price is above the shutdown price. This is because each unit of output sold generates at least enough revenues as (non-fixed) variable costs, \\(pq \\geq VC(q)\\) or (dividing by \\(q)\\) \\(p \\geq AVC(q)\\).\nA firm will shut down production in the short run if it earning no producer surplus. This would happen if it earns fewer revenues than (non-fixed) variable costs: \\(pq < VC(q)\\) or (dividing by \\(q)\\) \\(p < AVC(q)\\).\nThus producer surplus exists \\(\\iff p>AVC(q)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Rents\nEconomic rents come from factors of production that are fixed in supply (talent, productive land, etc.). Take productive land for a moment, which has a fixed supply. There would be just as much land supplied at a price of zero dollars as at $1000 (its factor supply curve is perfectly inelastic), because (assume for a moment) we can’t produce any more of it.\nFor the economy as a whole, it is the price of agricultural products that determines the value of agricultural land (used to grow agricultural products). But for the individual farmer (firm producing food), the value of her land that she rents is a cost of production that enters into the pricing of her product.\nBelow, \\(AVC(q)\\) represents the average cost curve for all variable factors of production, i.e. excluding land costs (the fixed factor). If the price of the crop grown on this land is p∗, then the “profits” attributable to the land are measured by the area in orange: these are the economic rents. This is how much the rent (price) of the land would be in a competitive market — whatever it took to drive the profits to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn long run equilibrium, if there is competition for the productive land, the price of the land will be bid upwards, raising the cost to the farmers who must rent it, and raising the income to the owner of the land. Thus, economic rents increase to push profits to the firms to zero (but higher-than-opportunity-cost returns to the owners of land), since they must pay more to rent it.\nThe average cost curve including the cost of the land is \\(AC(q)\\). Since the equilibrium rent for the land will be whatever it takes to drive firm profits to zero:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{R(q^\\star) - C(q^\\star)}_{\\pi} &= 0\\\\\np^\\star q^\\star - VC(q^\\star) - rent &= 0\\\\\nrent &= p^\\star q^\\star - VC(q^\\star)\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn other words, economic rent is the difference between revenues \\((p^\\star q^\\star)\\) and variable costs. On the graph below, this is shaded in orange; we can also see it per unit as the difference between price and average variable costs (i.e. \\(AFC(q))\\).\nThis shows that rent is also precisely the same thing as producer surplus (discussed above). That means you can also calculate the economic rent as the area to the left of the marginal cost curve, etc.\nGiven what we said in the equations above, it is now easier to see the truth of what we said earlier: it is the market equilibrium price that determines economic rents, not the reverse. The firm supplies along its marginal cost curve — which is independent of the cost of the fixed factors. Rents will adjust to drive profits to zero.\n\n\nThe Shape of the Long Run Industry Supply Curve: External Economies\nWhen all firms produce more/less or firms enter or exit an industry due to profits or losses, this affects the equilibrium market price, and is commonly called the “entry price effect”.\nThe simplest way to see this is to simply consider a series of supply and demand graphs where there are profits or losses that cause a change in supply:\n\nEntry of new firms into a profitable industry will cause an increase in supply (supply curve shifts to the right), and thus a decrease in market price\n\n\nIn the graph below, Supply 1 to Supply 2\n\n\nExit of firms out of an industry suffering losses will cause a decrease in supply (supply curve shifts to the left), and thus an increase in market price\n\n\nIn the graph below, Supply 1 to Supply 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExactly how large this effect will be depends on the idea of external economies of scale1: how the scale of industry output affects costs for all firms in the industry.\nRecall that “economies of scale” refer to how a firm’s average costs change with its output — and is often referred to as “internal economies of scale” since the economic effect is captured by the individual firm: e.g. under economies of scale, if it produces more, its average costs decrease.\nWhat we are considering now is a form of externality: how the size and output of an entire industry “spills over” to all the firms by affecting their costs. An increase in the size of an industry (in terms of firms and total output) might have no effect on costs for all the firms in the industry, raise costs for all the firms, or lower costs for all the firms. As such, these are the three possibilities:\n\nConstant Cost Industry (no external economies) — horizontal LR supply curve\nIncreasing Cost Industry (external diseconomies) — upward sloping LR supply curve\nDecreasing Cost Industry (external economies) — downward sloping LR supply curve (!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOften referred to simply as “external economies.”↩︎"

    "text": "Take notes. On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components – an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.\n\nMy suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.\n\nAt least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can’t rely on heuristics or memory to “fill in the blanks.” You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it’s discovered you haven’t done the reading.\nDo the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you “get inside my head” and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade.\nWork on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don’t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.1 As a wise woman once told me “whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.”\nLearn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that’s relevant in the real world.2\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nYes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!↩︎\nYes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.↩︎"

This toolkit is the analytical foundation for exploring all fields and applications of economics as a social science, has many practical applications in business, finance, politics, and insights into any realm of human endeavors. Economics, after all, is the study of human action. At the intermediate level, these concepts are made more rigorous through the use of mathematical models, but we will first and foremost lay the theoretical foundations with economic intuition. As such, this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses by taking principles of microeconomics (ECON 206).\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning."

Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy."

Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment."

Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:"

Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X’?” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”)."

Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n\nChatGPT\nThe rise of ChatGPT and other large language models has made it incredibly easy to look up information and write content. This emerging capability will inevitably run up against existing (nearing obsolete) policies regarding academic integrity. Learning to leverage AI is an emerging skill, and one that can help you enhance your productivity.\nIn the end, you are ultimately responsible for all the content that you submit for assignments in this course. If it is clear that you simply submitted the results of a ChatGPT prompt for an assignment (and new tools are emerging to accurately detect his), you will earn a grade of zero. If it is clear that this is a frequent issue and you are applying no effort to your assignment beyond ChatGPT prompts, you will be reported for violations of the Academic Honor Code.\nBeware the limits of ChatGPT and other LLM-based AIs: low-quality prompts will give you low quality results, and ones that are obvious that the content was written by an LLM. The writing style and type of information that it outputs is fairly easy to detect among an expert in the field (i.e. me, if you ask it questions about economics, especially my assignments). Do not trust everything it says, it can pass off facts and arguments as authoritative. I have given it prompts and it gave me answers that it completely fabricated."
