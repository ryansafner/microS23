# Producer Behavior

.pull-left[

- How do **producers** decide:
  - which products to produce
  - in what quantity
  - using which inputs
  - and sold at what price?

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for .hi-red[supply curves]

# The Basics of Production

.pull-left[

- Nearly all goods must be **produced** before we can exchange & consume them

- .hi[Consumption] is the **using up** of value to gain utility
  - .hi-purple[Consumption is the ultimate goal of all economic activity]

# The Basics of Production

.pull-left[

- .hi[Production] is the **creation** of value, by transforming *lower*-valued goods (resources, inputs, etc) into *higher*-valued goods (outputs, consumer products, etc)

- Iron Ore $\rightarrow$ Steel $\rightarrow$ Buildings, Bridges, Ovens, Water Bottles

# It's Demand all the Way Down!

.pull-left[

- .hi-red[Supply] is actually .hi-blue[Demand] in disguise!

- An .hi[(opportunity) cost] to buy (scarce) inputs for production because **other people** .hi-blue[demand] those same inputs to consume or produce **other valuable things**!
  - Price necessary to **pull them out of other valuable productive uses** in the economy!

# What Do Firms Do?

# The Firm

.pull-left[
- In modern market economies, most production takes place in an organization known as a .hi[firm]
  - A legal fiction for particular purposes

- It does not *have* to be this way, and for most of history it was not this way!
    - Craft guilds
    - Independent artisans
    - Independent contractors

# If Markets Are So Great, Why Do Firms Exist?

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Firms exist in the forms they do because they are .hi-turquoise[an efficient response to particular problems of economic organization]

- Lots of interesting & Nobel-prize winning analysis

- For now, we'll sidestep these and just *assume* firms exist. Learn more in my .hi[Industrial Organization] course:

# What Do Firms Do? I

- How would we set up an optimization model:

1. **Choose:** .hi-blue[ < some alternative >]

2. **In order to maximize:** .hi-green[< some objective >]

3. **Subject to:** .hi-red[< some constraints >]

# Who Gets the Profits? II

.pull-left[
$$\pi=\underbrace{pq}_{revenues}-\underbrace{(wl+rk)}_{costs}$$

- Residual claimants have incentives to maximize firm's profits, as this *maximizes their own income*

- Entrepreneurs and shareholders are the only participants in production that are *not* guaranteed an income!
    - Starting and owning a firm is inherently **risky**!

# Profits and Entrepreneurship: A Preview

.pull-left[

- In markets, production must face the .hi[profit test]:
    - <span class="hi-purple">Is consumer's willingness to pay $>$ opportunity cost of inputs?</span>

- Profits are an indication that **value is being created for society**

- Losses are an indication that **value is being destroyed for society**

- Survival in markets *requires* firms continually create value & earn profits
