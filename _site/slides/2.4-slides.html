- We assume (for now) the firm is in a .hi[competitive] industry:

`$$\pi=\underbrace{pq}_{revenues}-\underbrace{(wl+rk)}_{costs}$$`

- We’ll first take a closer look at .hi[costs] today

- In functioning markets, .hi-purple[the market price measures the opportunity cost of using a resource for an alternative use]

- Firms not only pay for direct use of a resource, but also indirectly compensate society for *“pulling the resource out”* of alternate uses in the economy!

&gt; “The direction of all economic affairs is in the market society a task of the entrepreneurs. Theirs is the control of production. They are at the helm and steer the ship. A superficial observer would believe that they are supreme. But they are not. They are bound to obey unconditionally the captain's orders. .hi[The captain is the consumer.] Neither the entrepreneurs nor the farmers nor the capitalists determine what has to be produced. The consumers do that. If a businessman does not strictly obey the orders of the public as they are conveyed to him by the structure of market prices, he suffers losses, he goes bankrupt, and is thus removed from his eminent position at the helm. Other men who did better in satisfying the demand of the consumers replace him.”

&gt; “The consumers patronize those shops in which they can buy what they want at the cheapest price. .hi[Their buying and their abstention from buying decides who should own and run the plants and the land. They make poor people rich and rich people poor. They determine precisely what should be produced, in what quality, and in what quantities,]” (p.270).

# Costs in the Short Run
 
- .hi[Total cost function, `\\(C(q)\\)`] relates output `\(q\)` to the total cost of production `\(C\)`&lt;sup&gt;.magenta[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

`$$C(q)=f+VC(q)$$`

- Two kinds of short run costs:

**1.** .hi[Fixed costs, `\\(f\\)`] are costs that do not vary with output
  - Only true in the short run! (Consider this the cost of maintaining your capital)

--

**2.** .hi[Variable costs, `\\(VC(q)\\)`] are costs that vary with output (notice the variable in them!)
  - Typically, the more production of `\(q\)`, the higher the cost
  - e.g. firm is hiring *additional* labor
