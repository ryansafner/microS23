- Our models so far have given us interesting results: 
  - Markets reach equilibrium
  - Economic profits are zero in the long run in competitive markets

- Both are **fictional**!

- But the models **still** show us useful insights about how a market economy works

- Some readings in today’s readings page to help you understand

- Under true .hi[uncertainty], it’s not that we can’t assign probabilities to each outcome; we do not even have the knowledge necessary to list all possible outcomes!

- Requires .hi-purple[entrepreneurial judgment] to *both*:
  1. estimate possible actions *and*
  2. estimate the likelihood of their success

- .hi[Entrepreneur] is central player, earns pure profits (a residual) for *bearing uncertainty*
