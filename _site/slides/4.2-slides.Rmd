- No market is perfectly competitive, but **that does not .ul[necessarily] imply market failure**
  - Static vs. dynamic benefits of markets

- Market power is *interesting*
  - Most firms clearly have *some* market power
  - Market power $\neq$ bad, necessarily!

- Today, we’ll examine what I call .hi-purple[“the good, the bad, and the ugly” of market power]
  - (but not necessarily in that order)

- Consider an industry with some simplified cost assumptions:

$$C(q)=cq$$
  - No fixed cost; $\color{red}{MC(q)}=\color{orange}{AC(q)} = c$<sup>.magenta[†]</sup>

- If this industry were **competitive**, firms would set $\color{blue}{p_c}=\color{red}{MC(q)}$ and (collectively), industry would produce $q_c$
  - Max .blue[consumer surplus], $\color{green}{\pi=0}$

He dressed in monopoly lace, monopoly linen, monopoly leather, monopoly gold thread...His clothes were dyed with monopoly dyes.

# And Recall What Determines Price Elasticity!

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- A main determinant of price elasticity is the .hi-purple[availability of substitutes]!
  - More substitutes $\rightarrow$ higher elasticity $\rightarrow$ less market power
  - Universal substitute: not buying!

- So again, it’s .blue[Consumer Demand] all the way down!

- Aside: courts in .hi[antitrust] cases often also focus on the .hi-purple[cross-price elasticities] between goods!

> “For every product substitutes exist. But a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass that infinite a range. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within reasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will turn; in technical terms, products whose 'cross-elasticities of demand' are small,” *Times-Picayune Publishing v. United States*, 345 U.S. 594 at 621 n. 31 (1953)

> “Every manufacturer is the sole producer of the particular commodity it makes but its control in the above sense of the relevant market depends on the availability of alternative commodities for buyers: i.e., whether there is a cross-elasticity of demand between cellophane and the other wrappings,” *U.S. v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &. Co.*, 351 U.S. 377 (1956)

> “Cross-price elasticity is a more useful tool than own-price elasticity in defining a relevant antitrust market. Cross-price elasticity estimates tell one where the lost sales will go when the price is raised, while own-price elasticity estimates simply tell one that a price increase would cause a decline in volume,” *New York v. Kraft General Foods*, 926 F. Supp. 321 (1995)
