- No market is perfectly competitive, but **that does not .ul[necessarily] imply market failure**
  - Static vs. dynamic benefits of markets

&gt; “For every product substitutes exist. But a relevant market cannot meaningfully encompass that infinite a range. The circle must be drawn narrowly to exclude any other product to which, within reasonable variations in price, only a limited number of buyers will turn; in technical terms, products whose 'cross-elasticities of demand' are small,” *Times-Picayune Publishing v. United States*, 345 U.S. 594 at 621 n. 31 (1953)

&gt; “Every manufacturer is the sole producer of the particular commodity it makes but its control in the above sense of the relevant market depends on the availability of alternative commodities for buyers: i.e., whether there is a cross-elasticity of demand between cellophane and the other wrappings,” *U.S. v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp;. Co.*, 351 U.S. 377 (1956)

&gt; “Cross-price elasticity is a more useful tool than own-price elasticity in defining a relevant antitrust market. Cross-price elasticity estimates tell one where the lost sales will go when the price is raised, while own-price elasticity estimates simply tell one that a price increase would cause a decline in volume,” *New York v. Kraft General Foods*, 926 F. Supp. 321 (1995)

.pull-right[

- Think of an .hi[economic rent] as a “prize,” the payment a person receives for a good above its opportunity cost

- Creating rents creates competition for the rents, causing people to invest resources in .hi[rent-seeking]

- The social cost of the rent is all of the resources invested in rent-seeking!

- Political authorities intervene in markets in various ways that benefit some groups at the expense of everyone else
  - subsidies to groups (often producers)
  - regulation of industries
  - tariffs, quotas, and special exemptions from these

- These interventions create .hi[economic rents] for their beneficiaries by restricting competition

- The promise of earning a rent breeds **competition over the rents** (.hi[rent-seeking])
  - investments of resources to lobby political officials

- Markets serve **consumers** (“consumer sovereignty”), *not* producers (or workers, etc)!

- Successful market economies .hi-purple[produce wealth] and .hi-purple[destroy jobs] (and sometimes, industries)

- Economic growth `\(\equiv\)` more output with fewer inputs

- A .hi-purple[political problem]: why would producers permit the **destructive** side of creative destruction?

- Aren't monopolies illegal in the U.S.?

- **No**: most monopolies exist *because* of explicit or implicit government-backing

  - Some markets and regulators are .hi-purple[captured] via **rent-seeking** firms to block competition (**“the ugly”**)
