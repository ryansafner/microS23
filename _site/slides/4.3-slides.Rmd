- The most obvious way to capture more surplus is to raise prices
  - But **Law of Demand** $\implies$ this would turn many customers away!

- Also, we saw that if a firm wants to sell more units, it has to lower the price on all units!

# Sales

- .hi-purple[Price-elastic] buyers will be attracted to buying something when price is lower

- Stores lower prices on rare occasions to attract price-sensitive shoppers (will lose profits on price-insensitive shoppers who buy during the sale!)
  - Black Friday: many price-insensitive shoppers stay away to avoid crowds! Better for the stores!

.green[**Example**]: Suppose you run a bar in downtown Frederick, and estimate the nightly demands for beer from undergraduates $(U)$ and graduates $(G)$ to be:

$$\begin{align*}
q_U&=18-4p_U\\
q_G&=12-p_G\\
\end{align*}$$

Assume the only cost of producing a beer is a constant marginal (and average) cost of $2.

1. If your bar had to charge a uniform price for beer, how much profit would the bar earn?

2. If you could price discriminate, how much profit would the bar earn?

  - Price discrimination requires market power, firm with market power marks up price based on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$
  - Competitive firm only sets $p=MC$, so change in elasticity has no effect on price

> “It is not because of the few thousand francs which would have to be spent to put a roof over the third-class carriage or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches ... What the company is trying to do is prevent the passengers who can pay the second-class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich ... And it is again for the same reason that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing with first-class customers. Having refused the poor what is necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous.” — Jules Dupuit

# Tying I

  - One good often the “base” and the other are “refills” that you may need to buy more of

- Companies often **sell printers at marginal cost** (no markup) and sell the **ink/refills at a much higher markup**

- **Reduce arbitrage**:
  - printer requires specific ink
  - ink only words with that specific printer

- If printers & ink were **not** tied:
  - **printers** would be **more expensive**
  - **ink** would be  **cheaper**

- High-volume users would keep buying ink and save money (vs. tied)

- Low-volume users might not buy the (now expensive) printer at all!

- Often, consumers do not want all products in the bundle

- Or, if they were able to buy just part of the bundle, they would *not* buy the other parts
