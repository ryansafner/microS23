# Price Discrimination

.pull-left[

- The most obvious way to capture more surplus is to raise prices
  - But **Law of Demand** `\(\implies\)` this would turn many customers away!

- Also, we saw that if a firm wants to sell more units, it has to lower the price on all units!

- .hi-purple[Price-elastic] buyers will be attracted to buying something when price is lower

- Stores lower prices on rare occasions to attract price-sensitive shoppers (will lose profits on price-insensitive shoppers who buy during the sale!)
  - Black Friday: many price-insensitive shoppers stay away to avoid crowds! Better for the stores!

# Coupons

  - Often lower income, very sensitive to price, worth the hassle of collecting &amp; using coupons

- Store sells at higher price (to capture profit from price-insensitive shoppers who can’t be bothered with coupons) and brings in profits from price-sensitive shoppers who use coupons to pay lower price

- Firm treats each segment as a *different* market
  1. Find q*: `\(MR(q)=MC(q)\)` 
  2. Raise p* to maximum WTP (Demand)

`$$\underbrace{\frac{p-MC(q)}{p}}_{\text{Markup % of Price}}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon}$$`

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose you run a bar in downtown Frederick, and estimate the nightly demands for beer from undergraduates `\((U)\)` and graduates `\((G)\)` to be:

`$$\begin{align*}
q_U&amp;=18-4p_U\\
q_G&amp;=12-p_G\\
\end{align*}$$`

Assume the only cost of producing a beer is a constant marginal (and average) cost of $2.

1. If your bar had to charge a uniform price for beer, how much profit would the bar earn?

2. If you could price discriminate, how much profit would the bar earn?

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

  - Price discrimination requires market power, firm with market power marks up price based on `\(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\)`
  - Competitive firm only sets `\(p=MC\)`, so change in elasticity has no effect on price

&gt; “It is not because of the few thousand francs which would have to be spent to put a roof over the third-class carriage or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches ... What the company is trying to do is prevent the passengers who can pay the second-class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich ... And it is again for the same reason that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing with first-class customers. Having refused the poor what is necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous.” — Jules Dupuit

# Tying II

.pull-left[

- Segment the market into:

1. .hi-purple[High-volume users]: buy more ink over time; pay more per sheet printed

2. .hi-purple[Low-volume users]: buy less ink; pay less per sheet printed

- **Indirect** price-discrimination: firms **don't know** what kind of user you are in advance

# Tying: Good or Bad?

.pull-left[

- Again, a tradeoff:

- Increased profits and reduced consumer surplus, reduced deadweight loss

- Spreads fixed cost of research &amp; development over more users

 # Tying: Good or Bad?

.pull-left[

- If printers &amp; ink were **not** tied:
  - **printers** would be **more expensive**
  - **ink** would be  **cheaper**

- High-volume users would keep buying ink and save money (vs. tied)

- Low-volume users might not buy the (now expensive) printer at all!

# Bundling I

.pull-left[

- Firms often .hi[bundle] products together as a single package, and refuse to offer individual parts of the package

- Often, consumers do not want all products in the bundle

- Or, if they were able to buy just part of the bundle, they would *not* buy the other parts

# Bundling: Good or Bad?

.pull-left[

- Again, a tradeoff:

- Increased profits and reduced consumer surplus, reduced deadweight loss

- Spreads fixed cost of research &amp; development over more users

- Goods with high fixed costs and low marginal costs (software, TV, music) increase profits from bundling
  - increases innovation and investment in these industries
