## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer's constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use [Lagrangian multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier) and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. [Take the full Lagrangian equation and solve for all partial derivatives, set equal to 0.] We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make a lot of intuitive sense. That rule, equivalently expressed in two ways:

$$
\begin{align*}\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} &= \frac{p_x}{p_y}\\
\frac{MU_x}{p_x} &= \frac{MU_y}{p_y}\\ 
\end{align*}
$$
The first rule states that the slope of the indifference curve (left) equals the slope of the budget constraint (right). This is stating that the marginal benefit of consuming $x$ (left) equals the marginal cost (right) of consuming $y$, and that the individual is trading off $y$ for $x$ at the same rate as the market is.

The second (version of the) rule, solved for $x$ and $y$ terms on either side, shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across both (all) goods. 

Both forms are often called the **equimarginal rule**, that at the optimum choice, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost (which is the marginal benefit of the next best foregone opportunity).

We will do some [practice](/practice/1.4-practice) to make sure you can solve this type of model, and then you are fully prepared for [Problem Set 1](/assignment/01-problem-set).

I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
