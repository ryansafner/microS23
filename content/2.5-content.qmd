## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we briefly discuss revenues before we put them together to solve the firm's *profit maximization problem*. We focus on the *short run*, where the firm incurs fixed costs and must stay in the market regardless. We derive the firm's (inverse) *supply curve*.

Next class will be about the long run, and finish up unit 2.

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. 

::: callout-tip
You can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.
:::

I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
