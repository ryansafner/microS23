## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we consider how markets work and why (and when) they are so efficient at allocating resources and solving social problems. We take a crack at defining efficiency in a few ways: [allocative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocative_efficiency), [productive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_efficiency), [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency), and [Kaldor-Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor%E2%80%93Hicks_efficiency) efficiency. We then discuss [Welfare Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics) and I summarize three conditions about when markets are good & efficient:
1. Markets are competitive
2. Markets reach equilibrium
3. Markets do not have externalities

This leads us into a discussion of [market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), when markets *aren’t* efficient because something prevents the price system from working properly. We talk about several types of market failures: collective action problems, public goods, and externalities.

## <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Ch. 14.2-14.7, Ch. 16 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019

Your textbook does cover efficiency and welfare economics in Chapter 14, in the context of general equilibrium theory, which is a bit too advanced for us to spend sufficient time to cover. Thus, I would not recommend reading that chapter unless you are prepared to dive into new tools (Edgeworth diagrams, production possibilities frontiers) that I will not cover in this course.

Chapter 16, however, is a pretty accessible discussion of externalities and public goods.
