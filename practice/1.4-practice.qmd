# Question 1
Suppose you can watch movies in the theater ($t$) and streaming at home ($s$), and earn utility according to the utility function: 
$$u(t,s)=4ts$$

Where your marginal utilities are: 
$$\begin{align*}
MU_t&=4s\\
MU_s&=4t\\ \end{align*}$$

## Part A 
Put $t$ on the horizontal axis and $s$ on the vertical axis. Write an equation for $MRS_{t,s}$ 

## Part B 
Would bundles of $(2,2)$ and $(1,4)$ be on the same indifference curve?

## Part C
Sketch this indifference curve. 

## Question 2
You can get utility from consuming Soda $(s)$ and Hot dogs $(h)$, according to the utility function:

$$u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}$$

The marginal utilities are:

$$\begin{align*}
MU_s&=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5}	\\
MU_h&=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}$$

You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.

## Part A 
What is your utility-maximizing bundle of Soda and Hot dogs?

## Part B
How much utility does this provide?
