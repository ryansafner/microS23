# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have .hi[objectives] they value

- Agents face .hi[constraints]

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

# Rational Choice Theory

# The Logic of Choice: Ends and Means

.pull-left[
- Each of us acts .hi-purple[purposefully]

- We have .hi[ends], goals, desires, objectives
  - *Anything* you value!

- We use .hi[means] in the world that we *believe* will achieve our ends
  - .hi-purple[“utility”] when we .hi[consume] services, or
  - if scarce physical object: .hi[“economic good”] or .hi[resource]

# The Logic of Choice: Purpose

.pull-left[

- Acting with .hi-purple[purpose] distinguishes humans from everything else in the universe

- Artificial intelligence researchers face .hi-turquoise[“the frame problem”]
  - Perception requires motivational goals to determine how to filter reality

# Causal Inference I

.pull-left[
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence are “dumb”
  - Data can never “speak for itself!”

- With the right models and research designs, we *can* say “X causes Y” and quantify it!

- Economists are in a unique position to make *causal* claims that mere statistics cannot

“First, the field of economics has spent decades developing a toolkit aimed at investigating empirical relationships, focusing on techniques to help understand which correlations speak to a causal relationship and which do not. This comes up all the time — does Uber Express Pool grow the full Uber user base, or simply draw in users from other Uber products? Should eBay advertise on Google, or does this simply syphon off people who would have come through organic search anyway? Are African-American Airbnb users rejected on the basis of their race? These are just a few of the countless questions that tech companies are grappling with, investing heavily in understanding the extent of a causal relationship.”

# The Law of Demand

.pull-left[
- Perhaps the most fundamental economic “law” is the .hi[law of demand]: 
  - **inverse relationship between price and quantity consumed**
  - i.e. demand curves slope downwards

- We investigate its source, and derive more useful properties

- First, we will need to develop a more rigorous framework

  - which products to buy
  - which activities to dedicate time to
  - how much to save or invest
  - how to plan for the future

- .hi[Rational choice theory]: assume that people .hi-purple[optimize within constraints]

- A model of behavior we can extend to most scenarios

# Rational Choice Theory: Beyond Consumers

.pull-left[

- Often called .hi[“Consumer Theory”] in textbooks, but realize:

- .hi-turquoise[*Everyone* is “a consumer”]
  - "Goods and services" are *anything* that you value!
  - Producers demand productive inputs

- We are really modeling how **individuals** make choices in almost *any* context!

.hi-green[**Example**]: Suppose you have an income of $50 to spend on lattes $(l)$ and burritos $(b)$. The price of lattes is $5 and the price of burritos is $10. 

Let $l$ be on the horizontal axis and $b$ be on the vertical axis.

1. Write an equation for the budget constraint (in graphable form).
