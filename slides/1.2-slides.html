# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have .hi[objectives] they value

- Agents face .hi[constraints]

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[
![](../images/optimize.jpeg)
]
]

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

# Rational Choice Theory

# The Logic of Choice: Ends and Means

.pull-left[
- Each of us acts .hi-purple[purposefully]

- We have .hi[ends], goals, desires, objectives
  - *Anything* you value!

- We use .hi[means] in the world that we *believe* will achieve our ends
  - .hi-purple[“utility”] when we .hi[consume] services, or
  - if scarce physical object: .hi[“economic good”] or .hi[resource]

]

![](../images/happiness.png)

]

---

# The Logic of Choice: Purpose

.pull-left[

- Acting with .hi-purple[purpose] distinguishes humans from everything else in the universe

- Artificial intelligence researchers face .hi-turquoise[“the frame problem”]
  - Perception requires motivational goals to determine how to filter reality

]

.pull-right[

.center[

# Causal Inference I

.pull-left[
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence are “dumb”
  - Data can never “speak for itself!”

- With the right models and research designs, we *can* say “X causes Y” and quantify it!

- Economists are in a unique position to make *causal* claims that mere statistics cannot

“First, the field of economics has spent decades developing a toolkit aimed at investigating empirical relationships, focusing on techniques to help understand which correlations speak to a causal relationship and which do not. This comes up all the time — does Uber Express Pool grow the full Uber user base, or simply draw in users from other Uber products? Should eBay advertise on Google, or does this simply syphon off people who would have come through organic search anyway? Are African-American Airbnb users rejected on the basis of their race? These are just a few of the countless questions that tech companies are grappling with, investing heavily in understanding the extent of a causal relationship.”

# The Law of Demand

.pull-left[
- Perhaps the most fundamental economic “law” is the .hi[law of demand]: 
  - **inverse relationship between price and quantity consumed**
  - i.e. demand curves slope downwards

- We investigate its source, and derive more useful properties

- First, we will need to develop a more rigorous framework

  - which products to buy
  - which activities to dedicate time to
  - how much to save or invest
  - how to plan for the future

- .hi[Rational choice theory]: assume that people .hi-purple[optimize within constraints]

- Often called .hi[“Consumer Theory”] in textbooks, but realize:

- .hi-turquoise[*Everyone* is “a consumer”]
  - "Goods and services" are *anything* that you value!
  - Producers demand productive inputs

- We are really modeling how **individuals** make choices in almost *any* context!

In 2010, it still took four people 40 minutes to produce a performance. Stated differently, in the nearly 200 years between 1826 and 2010, there was no growth in string quartet labor productivity. In 1826 it took 2.66 labor hours to produce one unit of output, and it took 2.66 labor hours to produce one unit of output in 2010.”

# Economics is About (Changes in) *Relative* Prices

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Economic analysis is about (changes in) *relative* prices]

- Budget constraint slope (opportunity cost of `\(x)\)` is `\(-\frac{p_x}{p_y}\)`

- Only .hi-turquoise[“real”] changes in .ul[*relative*] prices (from changes in market conditions) change consumer constraints (and alter behavior)

- i.e. not “the price of `\(x\)`,” its about “the price of x *relative to the price of y*”!

# Economics is About (Changes in) *Relative* Prices

.pull-left[

- .hi-turquoise[“Nominal”] prices are often meaningless!
  - Need to make *comparisons* between prices of different goods

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
.hi-green[Example]: Imagine yourself in a strange country. All you know is that the price of bread, in local currency, is “6”...

# Changes in Relative Prices: Example

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Example**: Continuing the lattes and burritos example (income is $50, lattes are $5, burritos are $10).

1. Suppose the price of lattes doubles from $5 to $10. Find the equation of the new budget constraint and graph it.

2. Return to the original price of lattes ($5) and suppose the price of burritos falls from $10 to $5. Find the equation of the new budget constraint and graph it.

# Budget Constraint and the Law of Demand

.pull-left[

- Recall the .hi[law of demand]

- We can derive it right off the budget constraint!
  - As `\(\uparrow p_x\)`, person can consume less `\(x\)`
  - As `\(\downarrow p_x\)`, person can consume more `\(x\)`

- Notice I have made **no assumptions** about rationality, preferences, utility, etc to get this!

# Markets Do Not Require Individual Rationality

.pull-left[
- A lot of griping about "rationality" and whether people are truly "rational"
  - [Behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics), for example

- The law of demand does not require rational people! (utility-maximizers, etc)
  - or markets, for that matter, it's the direct result of .hi[scarcity]

- This is important: .hi-turquoise[markets don't *require* rational people, they *make* people rational!]
