- We assume (for now) the firm is in a .hi[competitive] industry:

1. Firms’ products are .hi-purple[perfect substitutes]

2. Firms are .hi-purple[“price-takers”], no one firm can affect the *market price*

# Profit

- Recall that profit is:
$$\pi=\underbrace{pq}_{revenues}-\underbrace{(wl+rk)}_{costs}$$

- We’ll first take a closer look at .hi[costs] today

- Next class we’ll put costs together with revenues to find optimal $q^*$ that maximizes $\pi$ (the first stage problem)

# Production Costs are Opportunity Costs

.pull-left[

- Remember, .hi[economic costs] are broader than the common conception of “cost”

- This leads to the difference between:
  - .hi-purple[Accounting profit]: revenues minus accounting costs
  - .hi[Economic profit]: revenues minus accounting + .ul[opportunity] costs

- .hi-red[Supply] is actually .hi-blue[Demand] in disguise!

- An .hi[(opportunity) cost] to buy (scarce) inputs for production because **other people** .hi-blue[demand] those same inputs to consume or produce **other valuable things**!
  - Price necessary to **pull them out of other valuable productive uses** in the economy!

- Because resources are scarce, and have rivalrous uses, .hi-turquoise[how do we know we are using resources efficiently??]

- In functioning markets, .hi-purple[the market price measures the opportunity cost of using a resource for an alternative use]

- Firms not only pay for direct use of a resource, but also indirectly compensate society for *“pulling the resource out”* of alternate uses in the economy!

- Opportunity cost is a *forward-looking* concept

- Choices made in the *past* with *non-recoverable* costs are called .hi[sunk costs]

> “The direction of all economic affairs is in the market society a task of the entrepreneurs. Theirs is the control of production. They are at the helm and steer the ship. A superficial observer would believe that they are supreme. But they are not. They are bound to obey unconditionally the captain's orders. .hi[The captain is the consumer.] Neither the entrepreneurs nor the farmers nor the capitalists determine what has to be produced. The consumers do that. If a businessman does not strictly obey the orders of the public as they are conveyed to him by the structure of market prices, he suffers losses, he goes bankrupt, and is thus removed from his eminent position at the helm. Other men who did better in satisfying the demand of the consumers replace him.”

> “The consumers patronize those shops in which they can buy what they want at the cheapest price. .hi[Their buying and their abstention from buying decides who should own and run the plants and the land. They make poor people rich and rich people poor. They determine precisely what should be produced, in what quality, and in what quantities,]” (p.270).

# Costs in the Short Run
 
- .hi[Total cost function, `\\(C(q)\\)`] relates output $q$ to the total cost of production $C$<sup>.magenta[†]</sup>

$$C(q)=f+VC(q)$$

--

- Two kinds of short run costs:

**1.** .hi[Fixed costs, `\\(f\\)`] are costs that do not vary with output
  - Only true in the short run! (Consider this the cost of maintaining your capital)

--

**2.** .hi[Variable costs, `\\(VC(q)\\)`] are costs that vary with output (notice the variable in them!)
  - Typically, the more production of $q$, the higher the cost
  - e.g. firm is hiring *additional* labor

  - rent for office space, durable equipment, operating permits (that are renewed)

# Average Costs

- .hi[Average Fixed Cost]: fixed cost per unit of output:

$$AFC(q)=\frac{f}{q}$$

--

- .hi[Average Variable Cost]: variable cost per unit of output:

$$AVC(q)=\frac{VC(q)}{q}$$

--

- .hi[Average (Total) Cost]: (total) cost per unit of output:

$$AC(q)=\frac{C(q)}{q}$$

---

# Marginal Cost

- .hi[Marginal Cost] is the change in total cost for each additional unit of output produced:

$$MC(q) = \frac{\Delta C(q)}{\Delta q}$$

- Calculus: first derivative of the cost function

- .hi-purple[Marginal cost is the *primary* cost that matters in making decisions]
  - All other costs are driven by marginal costs
  - This is the main cost that firms can “see”
