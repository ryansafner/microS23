There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. imperfect vs. incomplete/asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential games

# Solution Concepts

.pull-right[

.smallest[
- We use various .hi-purple[“solution concepts”] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- .hi[Nash Equilibrium] is the primary solution concept
  - Note it has *many* variants depending on type of game!

- Recall, .hi[Nash Equilibrium]: no players want to change their strategy given what everyone else is playing
  - All players are playing a best response to each other

# Solution Concepts: Nash Equilibrium

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

- Important about Nash equilibrium:

1. N.E. $\neq$ the “*best*” or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

2. Game may have *multiple* N.E.

3. Game may have *no* N.E. (in “pure” strategies)

.pull-right[
- .hi-purple[Path Dependence]: early choices may affect later ability to choose or switch

- Suppose we are currently in equilibrium (B,B)

- .hi-purple[Inefficient lock-in]:
  - Standard A is superior to B
  - But too costly to switch from B to A

# So What's the Point of All Our Models?

- In perfect competition (model):
  - price-taking firms set price equal to marginal cost
  - long run economic profits are zero
  - allocative efficiency: consumer and producer surplus maximized

- This is a *tendency* .hi[only because of **free entry and exit**]

- Judge them more on their level of contestability, look for barriers to entry

> "...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province.  In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless... — Suarez Miranda, *Viajes de varones prudentes*, Libro IV, Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658"

# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have .hi[objectives] they value

- Agents face .hi[constraints]

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

1. Believing the model accurately *describes* reality (100%) and ignoring the model’s flaws

2. Believing the model is ideal, and reality *should* be *corrected* to better match the model

# I’m Not An Idiot

- I know you most of you took this class as a business requirement...

- ...and will forget all the advanced tools in under a week

- They were/are meant to familiarize you with how economists model the world

- If you ever need to solve a problem, they are a tool may apply

# But Remembering the Takeaways Will Serve You

.pull-left[

.quitesmall[
Even if you aren’t going to be an economist, remember:

1. People respond to incentives

2. We all have to face tradeoffs (including in politics)

3. Everyone makes choices on the margin

4. People *tend* to adjust to each other towards a (predictable) equilibrium

5. Incentives and institutions matter (beware the nirvana fallacy)

6. Role of (potential) competition (over time) & free entry

7. Markets are a discovery process via prices, profit & loss 

8. Beware, rent-seeking is everywhere and cleverly hidden
