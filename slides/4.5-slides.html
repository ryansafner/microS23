There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. imperfect vs. incomplete/asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential games

# Solution Concepts

.pull-right[

.smallest[
- We use various .hi-purple[“solution concepts”] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- .hi[Nash Equilibrium] is the primary solution concept
  - Note it has *many* variants depending on type of game!

- Recall, .hi[Nash Equilibrium]: no players want to change their strategy given what everyone else is playing
  - All players are playing a best response to each other

.pull-right[

- Important about Nash equilibrium:

1. N.E. `\(\neq\)` the “*best*” or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

2. Game may have *multiple* N.E.

3. Game may have *no* N.E. (in “pure” strategies)

.pull-right[

Even if you aren’t going to be an economist, remember:

1. People respond to incentives

2. We all have to face tradeoffs (including in politics)

3. Everyone makes choices on the margin

4. People *tend* to adjust to each other towards a (predictable) equilibrium

5. Incentives and institutions matter (beware the nirvana fallacy)

6. Role of (potential) competition (over time) &amp; free entry

7. Markets are a discovery process via prices, profit &amp; loss 

8. Beware, rent-seeking is everywhere and cleverly hidden
